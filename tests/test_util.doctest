This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.util package. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality. This module is
meant for internal use by stdnum modules and is not guaranteed to remain
stable and as such not part of the public API of stdnum.

>>> from stdnum.util import (
...     get_number_modules, get_module_name, get_module_description)


The get_module_name() function is used in the example WSGI application and
release scripts to get the number's name. It should not end in a dot (even
though the docstring subject should).

>>> from stdnum import isbn
>>> get_module_name(isbn)
'ISBN (International Standard Book Number)'
>>> any(get_module_name(mod).endswith('.') for mod in get_number_modules())
False


The get_module_description() function is used in the example WSGI application
to extract the extended description of the number for presentation purposes.
The doctests should not be present in the descriptions.

>>> from stdnum import isbn
>>> get_module_description(isbn).startswith(
...     'The ISBN is the International Standard Book Number')
True
>>> any('>>>' in get_module_description(mod) for mod in get_number_modules())
False
