This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.iso7064 package. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.iso7064 import mod_11_10, mod_11_2, mod_37_2, mod_37_36, mod_97_10


These are normal variations of Mod 11, 10 that should just work.

>>> mod_11_10.validate('12323')
'12323'
>>> mod_11_10.validate('546794')
'546794'
>>> mod_11_10.calc_check_digit('0794')
'5'
>>> mod_11_10.validate('07945')
'07945'
>>> mod_11_10.calc_check_digit('00200667308')
'5'
>>> mod_11_10.validate('002006673085')
'002006673085'
>>> mod_11_10.validate('002006673084')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidChecksum: ...
>>> mod_11_10.calc_check_digit('00200667309')
'3'
>>> mod_11_10.calc_check_digit('00200667310')
'8'
>>> mod_11_10.calc_check_digit('00200667311')
'6'
>>> mod_11_10.calc_check_digit('00200667312')
'4'


These normal tests of Mod 11, 2 should just work.

>>> mod_11_2.calc_check_digit('0794')
'0'
>>> mod_11_2.validate('07940')
'07940'
>>> mod_11_2.calc_check_digit('079')
'X'
>>> mod_11_2.validate('079X')
'079X'

These normal tests of Mod 37, 2 should just work

>>> mod_37_2.calc_check_digit('G123498654321')
'H'
