This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.mac module. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum import mac


The module should properly convert numbers in various formats to a canonical
representation.

>>> mac.compact('d0:50:99:84:a2:a0')
'd0:50:99:84:a2:a0'
>>> mac.compact('D0-50-99-84-A2-A0')
'd0:50:99:84:a2:a0'
>>> mac.compact('D0:50:99:84:A2:A0')
'd0:50:99:84:a2:a0'
>>> mac.compact('d0:5:9:04:a2:a0')
'd0:05:09:04:a2:a0'


Various formatting problems are checked.

>>> mac.validate('d0:50:99:84:a2:a0:ff')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidLength: ...
>>> mac.validate('zz:50:99:84:a2:a0')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...
>>> mac.validate('00:00:00:00:00')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidLength: ...
>>> mac.validate('123:23:45:67:89:00')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidLength: ...


The module also has a few address classification functions.

>>> mac.is_unicast('d0:50:99:84:a2:a0')
True
>>> mac.is_multicast('d0:50:99:84:a2:a0')
False
>>> mac.is_broadcast('d0:50:99:84:a2:a0')
False
>>> mac.is_broadcast('FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF')
True
>>> mac.is_universally_administered('d0:50:99:84:a2:a0')
True
>>> mac.is_locally_administered('fe:54:00:76:07:0a')
True


We can lookup the organisation that registered the OUI part of the MAC
address.

>>> str(mac.get_manufacturer('2c:76:8a:ad:f2:74'))
'Hewlett Packard'
>>> str(mac.get_manufacturer('fe:54:00:76:07:0a'))  # libvirt MAC address
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...


The organisation lookup is performed by default on universally administered
addresses but can be forced or disabled.

>>> mac.validate('d0:50:99:84:a2:a0')
'd0:50:99:84:a2:a0'
>>> mac.validate('fd:ff:ff:84:a2:a0')  # constructed universally administered
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...
>>> mac.validate('fd:ff:ff:84:a2:a0', validate_manufacturer=False)
'fd:ff:ff:84:a2:a0'
>>> mac.validate('fe:54:00:76:07:0a')  # locally administered
'fe:54:00:76:07:0a'
>>> mac.validate('fe:54:00:76:07:0a', validate_manufacturer=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...
