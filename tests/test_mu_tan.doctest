This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.mu.tan module. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not really
useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.mu import tan


Tests for some corner cases.

>>> tan.validate('20405553')
'20405553'
>>> tan.validate('12345')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidLength: ...
>>> tan.validate('1234567V')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...
>>> tan.validate('42345678')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...
>>> tan.format('20405553')

These have been found online and should all be valid numbers.

>>> numbers = '''
...
... 20405553
... 18421000
...
... '''
>>> [x for x in numbers.splitlines() if x and not tan.is_valid(x)]
[]
