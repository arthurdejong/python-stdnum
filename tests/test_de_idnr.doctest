This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.de.idnr module. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not really
useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.de import idnr


The number should be 11 digits long, should contain only numbers and cannot
start with a zero.

>>> idnr.validate('116574261809')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidLength: ...
>>> idnr.validate('A6574261809')
Traceback (most recent call last):

InvalidFormat: ...
>>> idnr.validate('01234567896')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...


The first 10 digits of the IdNr is supposed to contain extactly one digit
twice (or three times since 2016) and all other digits in the number can only
appear once. This tries to catch some corner cases. Note that only the first
10 digits are considered for this.

>>> idnr.validate('1234567890 3')  # each digit once
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...
>>> idnr.validate('1123456789 0')  # one digit twice
'11234567890'
>>> idnr.validate('1112345678 6')  # one digit three times
'11123456786'
>>> idnr.validate('1111234567 8')  # one digit four times
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...
>>> idnr.validate('1122345678 5')  # two digits more than once
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...
