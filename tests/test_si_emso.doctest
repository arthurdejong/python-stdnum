This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.si.emso. It
tries to validate a number of numbers that have been found online.

>>> from stdnum.si import emso
>>> from stdnum.exceptions import *


Tests for some corner cases.

>>> emso.validate('0101006500006')
'0101006500006'
>>> emso.format(' 0101006 50 000 6 ')
'0101006500006'
>>> emso.validate('12345')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidLength: ...
>>> emso.validate('3202006500008')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...
>>> emso.validate('0101006500007')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidChecksum: ...
>>> emso.validate('010100650A007')

Tests helper functions.

>>> emso.get_gender('0101006500006')
'M'
>>> emso.get_gender('2902932505526')
'F'
>>> emso.get_region('0101006500006')
'50'
>>> emso.get_birth_date('0101006500006')
datetime.date(2006, 1, 1)


These have been found online and should all be valid numbers.

>>> numbers = '''
...
... 0101006500006
... 1211981500126
... 1508995500237
... 2001939010010
... 2902932505526
...
... '''
>>> [x for x in numbers.splitlines() if x and not emso.is_valid(x)]
[]
