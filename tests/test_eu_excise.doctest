This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.eu.excise module. It
tries to validate a number of Excise numbers that have been found online.

>>> from stdnum.eu import excise
>>> from stdnum.exceptions import *

These numbers should be mostly valid except that they have the wrong length.

>>> excise.validate('LU987ABC')
'LU00000987ABC'
>>> excise.validate('LU000000987ABC')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidLength: ...


These numbers should be mostly valid except that they have the wrong prefix.

>>> excise.validate('XX00000987ABC')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...


These have been found online and should all be valid numbers.

>>> numbers = '''
...
... LU 00000987ABC
... FR012907E0820
... '''
>>> [x for x in numbers.splitlines() if x and not excise.is_valid(x)]
[]
