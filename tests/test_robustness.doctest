This file contains some tests for modules in the stdnum package to
check whether all provided is_valid() functions can handle clearly
invalid junk.

>>> testvalues = ( None, '*&^%$', '', 0, False, object(), 'Q', 'QQ', '3')
>>> from stdnum.util import get_number_modules

Go over each module and try every value.

>>> for mod in get_number_modules():
...     results = [ x for x in testvalues if mod.is_valid(x) != False ]
...     if results:
...         print mod.__name__, results
