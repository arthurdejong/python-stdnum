This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.fi.hetu. It
tries to cover more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.fi import hetu
>>> from stdnum.exceptions import *


Normal values that should just work.

>>> hetu.validate('131052-308T')
'131052-308T'
>>> hetu.validate('131052+308T')
'131052+308T'
>>> hetu.validate('131052A308T')
'131052A308T'
>>> hetu.validate('131052a308t')
'131052A308T'

From the beginning of year 2023, additional century indicating signs were added.
This doesn't affect the checksum calculation.

>>> hetu.validate('131052B308T')
'131052B308T'

>>> hetu.validate('131052X308T')
'131052X308T'

Invalid checksum:

>>> hetu.validate('131052-308U')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidChecksum: ...


Invalid century indicator:

>>> hetu.validate('131052/308T')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...
>>> hetu.validate('131052T308T')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...


Invalid birth date:

>>> hetu.validate('310252-308Y')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...
>>> hetu.validate('130052-308R')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...

Leaving out the first zero is wrong:

>>> hetu.validate('10101-0101')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...


Test for invalid individual numbers. For historical reasons individual IDs
start from 002. The range from 900 to 999 is used as temporary identifiers
(which should only be allowed when `allow_temporary` parameter is explicitly
set to True).

>>> hetu.validate('131052-000V')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...
>>> hetu.validate('131052-9993')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidComponent: ...
>>> hetu.validate('131052-9993', allow_temporary=True)
'131052-9993'


compact() and format() don't do much special:

>>> hetu.compact('131052a308t')
'131052A308T'
>>> hetu.format('131052a308t')
'131052A308T'
