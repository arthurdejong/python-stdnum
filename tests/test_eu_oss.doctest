These have been found online and should all be valid numbers. Interestingly
the VIES VAT number validation does not support validating numbers issued
under the non-union or import schemes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAT_identification_number also lists
EU826010755 for Godaddy and EU826009064 for AWS but neither seem to be valid.

>>> [x for x in numbers.splitlines() if x and not oss.is_valid(x)]
