This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.imsi module. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum import imsi


Should be valid numbers:

>>> imsi.validate('502152100145324')
'502152100145324'
>>> imsi.split('502152100145324')
('502', '152', '100145324')


Under the 467 Mobile Country Code (MCC) there are both 2-digit and 3-digit
Mobile Network Codes (MNC). If we have a yet unknown MNC we still want to
mark the IMSI as valid (because the registry is changing often and can be
incomplete) but we are not able to correctly split it.

>>> imsi.validate('467 07 1234567890')
'467071234567890'
>>> imsi.split('467 07 1234567890')
('467', '071234567890')
