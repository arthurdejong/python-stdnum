This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.vatin module. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum import vatin


Check valid VAT numbers for several countries with existing validation:

>>> vatin.validate('FR 40 303 265 045')
'FR40303265045'
>>> vatin.validate('DE136,695 976')
'DE136695976'
>>> vatin.validate('BR16.727.230/0001-97')
'BR16727230000197'
>>> vatin.validate('el-082857563')
'EL082857563'
>>> vatin.validate('CHE-109.298.651 TVA')
'CHE109298651TVA'
>>> vatin.validate('XI 432525179')
'XI432525179'


Try validating invalid VAT numbers for country with validation:

>>> vatin.compact('FR 40 303')
'FR40303'
>>> vatin.validate('FR 40 303')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidLength: ...
>>> vatin.validate('FR')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...


Try validating not specifying a country:

>>> vatin.validate('')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...
>>> vatin.validate('00')
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
InvalidFormat: ...


Try to validate for countries with no VAT validation:

>>> vatin.validate('XX')

    ...
InvalidComponent: ...
>>> vatin.validate('US')
Traceback (most recent call last):
