This file contains more detailed doctests for the stdnum.bsn module. It
tries to test more corner cases and detailed functionality that is not
really useful as module documentation.

>>> from stdnum.nl import bsn


These are normal variations that should just work.

>>> bsn.is_valid('111222333')
True
>>> bsn.is_valid('111252333')
False

These are tests to check what happens when a wrong type is passed.

>>> bsn.is_valid(111222333) # integer, not string
False
>>> bsn.is_valid(None)
False
>>> bsn.is_valid('')
False
