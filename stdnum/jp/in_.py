"""IN (個人番号, kojin bangō, Japanese Individual Number).

The Japanese Individual Number (個人番号, kojin bangō), often referred to as My
number (マイナンバー, mai nambā), is assigned to identify citizens and residents.
The number consists of 12 digits where the last digit is a check digit. No
personal information (such as name, gender, date of birth, etc.) is encoded
in the number.
