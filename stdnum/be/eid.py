"""eID Number (Belgian electronic Identity Card Number).

The eID is an electronic identity card (with chip), issued to Belgian citizens
over 12 years old.
The card number applies only to the card in question and should not be confused
with the Belgian National Number (Rijksregisternummer, NumÃ©ro National),
that is also included on the card.

The card number consists of 12 digits in the form xxx-xxxxxxx-yy where
yy is a check digit calculated as the remainder of dividing xxxxxxxxxx by 97.
If the remainder is 0, the check number is set to 97.
