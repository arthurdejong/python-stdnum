"""Excise Number

The Excise Number is the identification number issued by the competent
authority in respect of the person or premises. It is used to identify the
taxpayers of excise taxes.

The first two letters are the ISO country code of the Member State where the
operator is located (e.g. LU);
The next 11 alphanumeric characters are the identifier of the operator.
The identifier must include 11 digits, shorter identifiers must be padded to
the left with zeroes (e.g. 00000987ABC)
