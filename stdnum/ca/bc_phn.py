"""BC PHN (British Columbia Personal Health Number).

A unique, numerical, lifetime identifier used in the specific identification
of an individual client or patient who has had any interaction with the
British Columbia health system. It is assigned only to and used by one person
and will not be assigned to any other person.

The existence of a PHN does not imply eligibility for health care services in
BC or provide any indication of an individual’s benefit status.

The PNH is a 10-digit number where the first digit is always 9, and the last
digit is a MOD-11 check digit.
