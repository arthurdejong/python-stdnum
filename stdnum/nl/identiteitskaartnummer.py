"""Identiteitskaartnummer, Paspoortnummer (the Dutch passport number).

Each Dutch passport has an unique number of 9 alphanumerical characters.
The first 2 characters are always letters and the last character is a number.
The 6 characters in between can be either.

The letter "O" is never used to prevent it from being confused with the number "0".
Zeros are allowed, but are not used in numbers issued after December 2019.
