"""The ISO 11649 structured creditor reference number consists of 'RF' followed
by two check digits and a number of 1-21 digits. The number
may contain letters.

The reference number is validated by moving RF and the check digits to the end
of the number, and checking that the iso7064 mod_97_10 checksum of this string
is 1.
