"""NIR (French personal identification number).

The NIR (Numero d'Inscription au Repertoire national d'identification
des personnes physiques) is a 15 digit number used to identify persons
in France. All persons born in France are registered in the Repertoire
national d'identification des personnes physiques (RNIPP) and assigned
a NIR which consists of 15 digits where the two final digits are check
digits. The NIR is used by French social security and is popularly known
as the "social security number".
